# AI Assistant Context

This section provides context for AI-assisted contributions to assistant-api.

## Scope and intent

- The project is a Python backend service for voice assistants.
- It provides a minimal, OpenAI-compatible TTS API with streaming audio output.
- Current behavior focuses on one-shot TTS; session-based or incremental TTS is future work.
- Documentation should stay factual and aligned with the current implementation.

## Guardrails

- Avoid introducing feature claims that are not implemented.
- Prefer current behavior over planned architecture.
- Keep documentation concise and easy to navigate.
