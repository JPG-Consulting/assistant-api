# AI Assistant Context

This section provides context for AI-assisted contributions to assistant-api.

## Scope and intent

- The project is a Python backend service for voice assistants.
- It will provide an OpenAI-compatible API.
- The current focus is Text-to-Speech (TTS) with streaming audio output.
- The architecture should remain clean and extensible for future TTS, STT, and LLM services.

## Guardrails

- Avoid introducing business logic or API details beyond high-level descriptions.
- Prefer clear, minimal scaffolding over implementation.
- Keep documentation concise and easy to navigate.
