# Developer Documentation

This section describes the current architecture and developer workflow for assistant-api.

## Topics

- Architecture overview: `architecture.md`
- Repository layout: `directory_structure.md`
- Known gaps and follow-ups: `../../TODO.md`

Session-based or incremental TTS is future work; documentation should reflect current behavior.
