This directory contains project documentation for the assistant-api service. The structure is intentionally simple and can be expanded as the project grows.

## Sections

- **User documentation**: Installation, configuration, and operational guidance.
- **Developer documentation**: Architecture, local development, and contribution workflow.
- **AI assistant context**: Context intended for AI-based contributors, including project goals, boundaries, and terminology.

See the subdirectories for details.
